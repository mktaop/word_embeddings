# word_embeddings
Code to create word embeddings using different techniques.
You will need to provide a file which has the text you will use to create word embeddings.  I would suggest you create a csv file and upload that.
There are snippets in the code that lets you process your text if you so desire; such as make everything lower case, etc.
It should work as is, but if not then you can google or ask chatgpt for help on your errors.
Please "STAR" if this helpful to you.
